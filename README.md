# cs4013
project for cs4013 
I have upload what is a basically a UML diagram just for what we need to do currently for the main code. Choose which 2 you want to work on (Conor and Sean), i would recommed the 
pairs owner and owners, property and taxCal, and tax and taxInformation. Since Ben is working on the GUI he doesn't need to do this part. - Wiki 21/11/20


GUI Progress update.
I have created a very basic GUI by following a tutorial. (All it contains is a stage, scene and a button that says "Click me") Unfortunately I could not run it as I dont have the neccasary packages as of yet. I will do my best to have some progress made every day. - Ben 20/11/20

GUI Progress update.
I still need to get the packages to run the code but now the GUI should be able to handle a user interaction of clicking the button, printing "Hello World" in the terminal.
I plan to progress with this and combine it with out lectures. -21/11/20
